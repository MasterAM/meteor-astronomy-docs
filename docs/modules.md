{{#template name="Modules"}}
Astronomy is highly modularized. Every Astronomy feature had been written as a module. Such approach gives a lot of flexibility when creating applications. We can choose what features do we need and add only them to the project. Thanks to that, we can minimize the application size and the load time. In this section we will discuss some external modules that are not a part of the core Astronomy package.
