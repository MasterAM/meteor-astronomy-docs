{{#template name="WritingBehaviors"}}
When you notice that you're repeating some parts of code over and over again for some classes it may be a good idea to create a behavior. Behavior is a module that provides some functionality for a class. It may be a feature that adds fields for storing document creation and modification dates that are automatically updated on document insert and update. It may be a feature add the slug field that stores an URL friendly form of a document title. There are some behaviors that had been already implemented and you can add them to the class. The example behavior that we will talk about it this section is `timestamp`.
