- [The "isModified()" method](#modified)
- [Direct database access](#direct-collection-access)
- Events

  - `before/afterInc`
  - `initDefinition`
  - `before/afterFind`
  - Stopping propagation in modification methods
- [A new way of inheriting from a class](#inheritance)
- [A new way of extending a class](#extending-class)
- Validation
  - The `validateAll()` method was removed and replaced with the `validate(false)` method (notice that the `false` value was passed as the first argument)
- Validators
  - `if`
  - `switch`
- Integration of the behaviors module. The `behaviors` module was integrated with the core Astronom package and the external module/package will be removed in the future.
- [Changes in behaviors creation](#writing-behaviors)
- The `supportLegacyBrowsers` configuration variable was removed. To support older browsers and simplify the Astronomy code, there was a need for abandoning some features from ES6 that can't be polyfilled. The only change is that you should always use [modification functions](#modifying-documents) to change values of the fields. You shouldn't change them directly.
