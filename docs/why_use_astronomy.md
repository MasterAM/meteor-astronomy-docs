{{#template name='WhyUseAstronomy'}}
There are many other packages that implement some of the functionality in Astronomy. I will try to point out here the main benefits of using Astronomy over other solutions.

- Besides having many features that are listed in the [Features](#features) section...
- ... Astronomy is highly modularized. This was one of the main principles when creating it. Thanks to that, anyone can easily hook into almost every process that happens in Astronomy. Developers can create their own modules, behaviors and validators.
- It's easy to learn. Astronomy does not reinvent the wheel. It takes the best from the tools you are already familiar with, not only from the JavaScript world, but also from other languages.
- When using Astronomy, you can easily replace three to five packages that you already use with a single one that follows the same pattern across all its modules. The main principle is simplicity.
- There are many developers who already use Astronomy and I allowed myself to post some of their comments here:

> If this package were around when I created SimpleSchema, I would have used it instead of creating SimpleSchema.

-- [Eric Dobbertin, author of SimpleSchema](https://github.com/jagi/meteor-astronomy/issues/27#issuecomment-110996499)

> I love your package, it's really great. As RoR developer, this package is really exciting!

> Anyway, very happy to have moved to astronomy, really like it we will release an app using it soon, so I will let you know.

> I still don't understand how this package is not getting more popular imho this package is better than simple-schema.

> Amazing work, beautifully designed package! Anyone give this package few seconds and take a look at sources? If people will write code in such clean and modular way, world would be better! Kudos Jagi!

> Amazing package indeed! Coming from a php MVC background, this package is a gift :). You rock!

> Thanks for creating an amazing package. I would request you to add two way data binding.

> Thanks - this has the makings of an amazing tool.... I'm hoping to replace Mesosphere, collection-hooks, collection-helpers, and a bunch of custom code - all with a cleaner code base!

-- other developers

I hope you will join us and become a happy user of Astronomy :)
